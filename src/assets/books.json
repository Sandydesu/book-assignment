      "description": "When developers move beyond building simple web sites or small applications, things get complicated. Managing data gets messy, handling browser incompatibilities takes time, juggling competing user interactions and integrating the work of multiple developers gets tricky. The Angular framework handles these common problems, making it ideal for writing large-scale web applications that can be maintained, extended, and tested. Because it's popular, it offers a well-supported code base, vibrant community, and rich ecosystem. Best of all, Angular emphasizes performance and focuses on mobile apps by being compact and memory efficient. Angular in Action teaches readers modern application development with Angular. It begins with the basics, such as key features of TypeScript, newer ES6 syntax and concepts, and details about the tools needed to write professional Angular applications. Next, readers learn how to build an Angular application from scratch. Using many examples, the book teaches the core parts of Angular, such as Components, the Router, and Services. It also covers techniques like server-side rendering and incrementally adding Angular to existing Angular applications. Finally, if offers insight into advanced skills, such as testing, tooling options, and performance tuning. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.",

      "description": "Learning Angular, Second Edition A Hands-On Guide to Angular 2 and Angular 4 Learning Angular teaches modern application development with Angular 2 and Angular 4. It begins with the basics of Angular and the technologies and techniques used throughout the book, such as key features of TypeScript, newer ES6 syntax and concepts, and details about the tools needed to write professional Angular applications. The reader will next build an Angular application from scratch while learning about the primary pieces of an Angular application and see how they work together. Using lots of examples, the core parts of Angular will be introduced, such as Components, the Router, and Services. The book also covers techniques like server-side rendering and how to incrementally add Angular 2+ features to existing AngularJS applications. Finally, the reader will gain insight into advanced skills that should be part of any professional Angular developer’s toolkit such as testing, tooling options, and performance tuning. Understand how Angular is organized and learn best practices for designing Angular applications Quickly build Angular templates with built-in directives that enhance the user experience Bind UI elements to your data model, so changes to your model and UI occur automatically in tandem Define custom Angular directives that extend HTML Implement zoomable images, expandable lists, and other rich UI components Implement client-side services that interact with web servers Build dynamic browser views to provide even richer user interaction Create custom services you can easily reuse Implement rich UI components as custom Angular directives Contents at a Glance Introduction What is Angular Why Use Angular Who this Book is For How to Use this Book Getting the Source Code Chapter 1: Jumping into JavaScript Setting Up a JavaScript Development Environment Defining Variables Understanding JavaScript Data Types Using Operators Implementing Looping Creating Functions Understanding Variable Scope Using JavaScript Objects Manipulating Strings Working with Arrays Adding Error Handling Chapter 2: Jumping into TypeScript Learning the Different Types Understanding Interfaces Implementing Classes Implementing Modules Understanding Functions Chapter 3: Getting Started with Angular Why Angular?

Reuse your code and build fast and high performing apps for any platform be it web, mobile web, native mobile and native desktop. You use small manageable components to build a large powerful app. No more wasting time hunting for DOM nodes! In this book, we take you on a fun, hands-on and pragmatic journey to master Angular from a web development point of view. You'll start building Angular apps within minutes. Every section is written in a bite-sized manner and straight to the point as I don't want to waste your time (and most certainly mine) on the content you don't need. In the end, you will have what it takes to develop a real-life app. About the Reader This book is for developers with basic familiarity with HTML, CSS, Javascript and object-oriented programming. No TypeScript or AngularJS experience needed. About the Author Greg Lim is a technologist and author of several programming books. Greg has many years in teaching programming in tertiary institutions and he places special emphasis on learning by doing.
